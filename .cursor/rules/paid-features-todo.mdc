## Monetization & Pro Analytics PRD (SoloStudy)

- **Status**: Draft
- **Owner**: Product
- **Goal**: Keep the core focus experience free while introducing a compelling Pro tier centered on analytics, exports, and integrations. Provide a clear upgrade path with soft caps and a strong value narrative for individuals and teams.

## Problem Statement

- **Today**: Users can focus and track sessions, but lack deep insights and automation to improve habits and outcomes.
- **Opportunity**: Add Pro analytics that surface trends, correlations, and forecasts, plus data portability and integrations, without degrading the free experience.

## Objectives and Success Criteria

- **North-star**: Weekly Active Focuser (≥3 sessions/week).
- **Primary KPIs**:
  - Trial-to-paid conversion
  - Cap-hit → upgrade rate
  - Export/API adoption
  - Team seat expansion
  - Churn by persona
- **Non-goals**:
  - No hard paywalls on starting/finishing a focus session
  - No collection of sensitive content data (tasks/notes optional and redacted by default)

## Personas

- **Individual**: Students, creators, indie devs seeking habit improvement.
- **Power user**: Data-minded individuals needing historical analyses and exports.
- **Team lead/educator**: Needs shared templates, aggregate analytics, seat management.

## Packaging and Tiers

- **Free**
  - Core focus room, timers, ambient audio/video
  - Basic history (30 days), daily/weekly summaries
  - Basic todos, sync, PWA offline
- **Pro (Individual)**
  - Unlimited history
  - Advanced analytics (segments, goals, streaks, anomaly hints)
  - CSV/JSON export, personal API, webhooks
  - Calendar sync, custom session templates, playlists/mixes
  - Priority support, 7–14 day trial
- **Teams/Education**
  - Seat-based, consolidated billing
  - Shared templates, shared dashboards
  - Org-level analytics, admin controls, SSO (as add-on)
- **Add-ons**
  - Integrations pack (Notion, Google Calendar, Slack/Discord)
  - Data export automation pack (scheduled exports to S3/Drive)
  - Advanced automations (scheduled sessions, reminders)

- **Quotas (defaults)**:
  - Free: 30-day history, 3 tags, 0 exports, 0 API, 1 automation, 5 dashboards
  - Pro: Unlimited history, unlimited tags, export/API on, 20 automations, 25 dashboards
  - Teams: Pro + org-level dashboards and higher shared limits

## Analytics Scope (Pro/Teams)

- **Session analytics**: duration, completion rate, interruptions, recovery time
- **Focus quality**: distraction events, idle windows, correlations with ambient/video
- **Segmentation**: project/tag, daypart, device, session type
- **Goals & forecast**: weekly/monthly targets, variance, projections
- **Streaks & retention**: rolling streaks, relapse recovery, habit health
- **Benchmarks**: personal vs baseline; team averages (Teams)
- **Insights**: anomaly detection and nudges (e.g., “productivity drops after 45 min”)
- **Exports & APIs**: CSV/JSON export, personal API, webhooks on session end
- **Privacy**: opt-out categories, anonymization for Teams, retention controls

## Visibility and Access States

- **Hidden (not visible)**: Experimental/region-restricted features behind feature flags/policies.
- **Teased (visible but locked)**:
  - Disabled controls with tooltip; blurred chart previews with Pro badge
  - Inline comparison cards and soft-limit CTAs (on cap hit)
- **Accessible (full access)**:
  - Unlocked UI, elevated quotas, advanced filters/pages enabled

## Enforcement Architecture

- **Entitlements**
  - Plans: `free`, `pro`, `team_member`, `team_admin`
  - Features: versioned capabilities (e.g., `analytics/segments@1`, `export/csv@1`)
  - Quotas: per-feature limits (historyDays, exportsPerMonth, webhooksPerMin)
  - Association: per-user and optional organization; included in session/JWT and server context
- **Server-side enforcement**
  - Gate analytics, exports, API/webhooks by entitlements
  - Apply quotas and rate limits; structured error with upgrade hints
  - Audit logs for overage and paywall hits
- **Client-side gating**
  - Read entitlements for show/hide/tease; never trust client alone
  - Reusable locked-state components with consistent upgrade CTAs
  - Progressive disclosure once meaningful data exists

## Billing and Lifecycle

- **Checkout & portal**: Hosted checkout, self-serve plan changes, proration
- **Trials & grace**: 7–14 day trial, grace on failed payments, auto-downgrade with data retained
- **Invoices & taxes**: VAT/GST support; student/EDU discounts
- **Teams**: Owner-managed seats, invites, roles; seat-based pricing; org cancellation logic

## Data, Privacy, Security

- **Event pipeline**
  - Client batching and offline queue; dedupe and schema validation server-side
  - Aggregations via scheduled jobs/materialized views
- **Privacy**
  - No raw content required; hash/redact sensitive strings
  - Do Not Track support; consent for telemetry; regional storage as needed
  - Tier-based retention (Free: 30–90 days; Pro/Team: user/org-controlled or unlimited)
- **Security**
  - Scoped API tokens; webhook signatures; IP/rate limits
  - Minimal PII; encryption at rest; key rotation policy

## Pricing (initial hypotheses)

- **Pro (Individual)**: Monthly + annual (2 months free); student discount
- **Teams**: Per-seat with volume tiers; EDU institutional pricing
- Pricing to be validated via experiments (geo and persona A/B)

## Growth and Conversion

- **Soft caps**: Hit history/tag/export limits → contextual upgrade prompts
- **Locked insights**: Blurred advanced charts with quantified preview value
- **Lifecycle nudges**: Weekly report email highlighting locked insights
- **Moments of joy**: After 3rd week or streak recovery, prompt trial
- **Referrals**: Credits for invitations; stackable with student discounts

## Launch Plan (Phases)

- **Phase 1**: Instrument events, basic aggregation, Free summaries
- **Phase 2**: Pro dashboards (segments, goals, streaks), soft caps, checkout
- **Phase 3**: Exports/API/webhooks, automations, team spaces
- **Phase 4**: EDU/SSO, add-ons, marketplace templates

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Over-collection risk**: Strict schema and redaction; opt-in categories
- **UX confusion**: Clear labels, consistent locked-state components, transparent limits
- **Gaming/free-riding**: Server-side quotas; tamper-proof counters; rate limiting
- **Churn from upsell pressure**: Maintain useful Free tier; emphasize value, not nags

## Open Questions

- What default retention (90d?) best balances privacy and value on Free?
- Which integrations land first for the integrations pack?
- Do we include calendar sync in Pro base or as an add-on?
- EDU pricing model: domain verification vs coupon-based?

## Acceptance Criteria (v1)

- Entitlement checks block Pro features server-side and reflect client state
- Free users can complete all core flows without friction
- Teased states appear consistently with upgrade CTAs
- Trials, billing, and downgrade paths preserve data safely
