# Ambient Sound Files

This directory contains ambient sound files for the SoloStudy focus room.

## Required Files

The following files should be placed in this directory:

- `rain.mp3` - Gentle rainfall sounds
- `forest.mp3` - Birds and rustling leaves
- `cafe.mp3` - Coffee shop ambience
- `ocean.mp3` - Calming ocean waves
- `white-noise.mp3` - Focus-enhancing white noise
- `fireplace.mp3` - Crackling fire sounds

## Audio Specifications

- **Format**: MP3
- **Quality**: 128kbps minimum
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes (will loop automatically)
- **Volume**: Normalized to prevent volume jumps

## Placeholder Implementation

Currently using placeholder URLs. In production, you would:

1. Source royalty-free ambient sounds
2. Optimize file sizes for web delivery
3. Consider CDN hosting for better performance
4. Add multiple variations of each sound type

## Alternative Approaches

For a production app, consider:

- **Web Audio API**: Generate sounds programmatically
- **Streaming**: Stream longer audio files
- **User Uploads**: Allow users to upload their own ambient sounds
- **3rd Party APIs**: Integrate with services like Freesound.org
